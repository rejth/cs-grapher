# ðŸ›  GrapherX

Simple library for work with **directed acyclic graphs**.

Graph is based on Adjacency List and provides the features below.

The algorithmic complexity of the operation is on the right.\
`V` - the total number of Vertices.\
`E` - the total number of Edges in the Graph.

Available features with the algorithmic complexity:
- [x] Add Vertex - `O(1)`
- [x] Add Edge - `O(1)`
- [x] Update Vertex and get adjacent Vertices - `O(1)`
- [x] Remove Vertex - `O(V + E)`
- [x] Remove Edge - `O(E)`
- [x] Breadth First search - `O(V + E)`
- [x] Depth First search - `O(V + E)`
- [x] Detect cycles in Graph - `O(V + E)`
- [x] Find the shortest path between two Vertices - `O(V + E)`
- [x] Find Mother Vertex - `O(V(V + E))`
